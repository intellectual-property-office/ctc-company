    Example URL - {baseUrl}/?CompanyNumber=12345678

    {

    Use this end point to return the health status of the microservice api.
    
    Example URL - {baseUrl}/health
3. GET request - error list

    Use this end point to return a JSON array containing a list of all the possible error codes and descriptions that the microservice could encounter and return.
    
    Example URL - {baseUrl}/error/list
